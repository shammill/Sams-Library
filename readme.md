# Sams Library

Have you ever stopped and thought to yourself "how do I do that again?"
Usually they are very specific tasks that you don't do often, maybe once a year.

Rather than trawl though stackoverflow for the exact solution, what if you had a quick library of familiar code?
That's the purpose of this library. Ranging from simple to complex complex code, I indend to add to this library over the years.
