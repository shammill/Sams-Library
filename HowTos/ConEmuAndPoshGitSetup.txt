Prefer using git commands? Would you like a git bash with modern features such as: tabs, autocomplete, etc, with the ability to run powershell and git from the same prompt?

Download and install ConEmu - https://conemu.github.io/
Follow the instructions to Install PoshGit - https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#installation
TL;DR: Run in powershell: PowerShellGet\Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser

Create a powershell profile using the following command: New-Item -path $profile -type file –force
This will create a new file located at: C:\Users\*username*\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Open the newly created file and add the following lines (obviously changing the location to your dev folder):

Import-Module posh-git
set-location C:\development\

Open ConEmu. Click the Menu button on the top right, and select Settings...
Click "Startup" and select "Specified named task", and then select PowerShell (Admin) from the list of options.
Finally, close ConEmu and reopen it.
 

The end result is a combined powershell/git that automatically opens to your development location with all the modern features.
